									<p><u><strong>Problem</strong></u><br>
										This was a problem that was being faced majorly by students and career persons looking to start a new life in German, it could be they are moving in for studies or to work, their frustrations are settling down quickly and how to go about the necessary registrations.<br> 
										<u><strong>Research</strong></u><br>
										From my research and interviews, I learnt the key major issues being faced by the users are Accommodation, insurance, Resident permit, Almedung and working student information, this helped me narrow down the problem to the HMW, how might we help users ease the stress of settling down in Germany.<br>
										<u><strong>Solution</strong></u><br>
										I came up with the idea to create an application to help users effectively check for informations about latest updates on moving to Germany, it also came from a personal experience, the application also provided platforms where users can easily learn from students and workers who have had experiences moving to Deutschland and a platform where users can reach out directly for help through direct chat.<br>
										<u><strong>Prototype</strong></u><br>
										Images narrated features/Content on every screens
										Test drive, concept test with some users
										Plenty of helpful documentation sums up the features for the prototype<br> 
										<u><strong>Takeaway</strong></u><br>
										I learnt that much design thinking can be surmountable to an application or websites, going into the future I will be improving on connecting the links for the accommodation to be able to direct users to see some available and affordable apartments that users can benefit from and also working on more features for the career changing users, I felt there was little for the career changing users

										<u><strong>Problem</strong></u><br>
										After gathering some insights about the problem itself and the current solutions available. I wanted to understand better who was my user, to see how they cope with trying to quit, which methods are they using. Couldn’t find a subject matter expert to interview, I opted for an online survey to help me define my target group.<br> I found out that people between 27 and 45 are willing to quit and have tried at least using one smoking application but only 3% succeeded, once I narrowed my target group I conducted several user interviews to get some qualitative data and gather more insights about why they didn’t succeed and what was thier experience with smoking apps, thier experience with other applications were little engagement, not challenging, this helped me narrow the solutions to HMW how might we help users distress in many ways rather than smoking.<br>
										<u><strong>Takeaway</strong></u><br>
										I felt there was still room for improvement on this project, The craving screens needs more features, going forward I will be improving more on that aspect. It was awesome to motivate users by delivering screens at which they could see money saved by not smoking as the feedback was great.
